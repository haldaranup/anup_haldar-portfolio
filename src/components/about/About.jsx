          When I created my first hand-coded webpage, I was so excited to learn
          more about these technologies. After completing my bachelor's in
          Science I got a chance to study full-stack web development at Masai
          School to enhance my coding skills. I learned MERN stack along with
          data structures & algorithms(DSA) and soft skills.

          Passionate about implementing and launching new projects. My
          specialties include learning new skills and programming languages,
          problem-solving, responsive design principles. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
